The testing notebooks are taken from the official Jupyter repository sample
notebooks section here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook,
and a clone of these samples taken for old notebook versions, here: https://github.com/odewahn/ipynb-examples

The downloaded notebook urls are:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/notebook/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynb
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/notebook/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odewahn/ipynb-examples/master/Part%201%20-%20Running%20Code.ipynb

There are two custom notebooks:
- `malformed.ipynb`, which is markdown cells with random sections deleted from
  it to break the JSON
- `stylish.ipynb`, which is a simple "FizzBuzz" program, written as the other
  notebooks don't pass pylint 100% of the time
