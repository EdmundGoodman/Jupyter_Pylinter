# Jupyter Pylinter

A simple tool to extract python code from a Jupyter notebook, and then run
pylint on it for static analysis.

The final production code for the project can be found here:

- [As a standalone python file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdmundGoodman/Jupyter_Pylinter/main/jupylint/jupylint.py)
- [As a package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jupylint/)
